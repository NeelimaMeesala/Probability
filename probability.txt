Probability = Possibility
Probability is the branch of mathematics concerning events and numerical descriptions of how likely they are to occur. The probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1; the larger the probability, the more likely an event is to occur. [Wiki]
<b> Probability Theory </b> - Analyses the random occurance of an event
1. Theoretical Probability
P(A) = (Number of outcomes favourable to Event A) / (Number of all possible outcomes)
2. Experimental Probability
P(E) = (Number of times event A happened) / (Total number of trials)
